							    <h3>SOLID</h3>
							    <p>I never in my life have had a more love hate relationship with an acronym than Solid. See as a bright-eyed intern, I took these words like gospel
							        and who can blame me? You listen to the benefits of these designs and you're taken in by this unheard of-etheral perfection the paradigm prings <br/>
							        Until it hits you: You've been lied to. The last three letters, sound cool and focused on, almost abstracted away themselves by good language design, and simply following common practice
							        Yet the SO get left out in the cold. This particularly bothers me because out of all the solid principle these are probably the two biggest and failure to yield to these as a OO dev are the fastest freeway to tech debt</p>
							    <p>Tech Debt, as many of the sayings of the world, something that has been subjugated into non-engineering discussions. Before I comment on what failure to follow paradigms yield, lets talk about Tech Debt
							        I've been blessed to be on two sides of this coin, I've worked with services that are brand new, and we could navigate around debt creators. I've always worked on services that pre-date my high-school times.
							        The biggest problem I've seen is failure to stop and really ponder: <i>"Is what this service about to do, what it's meant to do"</i>. Extension of services beyond their scope is the biggest hurdle I commonly see.
							        I believe this stems from our failure to follow the open-close principle. 
							    <p>The open-close principle is actually my favorite of all of Solid, because it makes you think about the future value of what you're writing.
							        Summing it up: <i>Make your classes, objects, and systems closed to changing responsibilites, but making them extensible in their roles</i>. I was mentoring an intern the other week, and we came upon a problem. Our data contract, was to delete all data related to this client from multiple no-sql file stores.
							        Smart kid, and made an orchestrator to do this, where he went wrong is harder to see. Before calling each of the specific delete handlers he checked in the orchestrator if the file ID for each individual file type was null. Thus the orchestrator now checked if say, a credit report should be deleted. This breaks the S and the O
							        The Orchestrator now has a series of if statements that determine who to call, thus extending it is injecting more objects into it and adding more decision logic. This should not live in an orhcestrator. The solution let every handler handle it's own fate.
							        Now, we just iterate over every handler and check to see if in our purge request we recieved that specific file type. To extend, we add more interfaces to our DI binding.
